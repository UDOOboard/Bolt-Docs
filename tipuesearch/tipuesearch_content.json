On UDOO BOLT you can run all the software available for the PC world, from gaming to video streaming, from graphical editors to professional development platforms, plus all the software for the Arduino\u00ae Leonardo world, including all the sketches, libraries and the official Arduino\u00ae IDE. UDOO BOLT embeds two processors: the new AMD Ryzen\u2122 Embedded V1000, V1605B or V1202B, 14nm, up to a 4-cores\/8-threads CPU, with a thermal design power of just 12-25W, designed for really fast Ultrathin Notebooks. This processor family brings together the breakthrough performance of the pioneering AMD \u201cZen\u201d CPU and AMD \u201cVega\u201d GPU architectures in a seamlessly-integrated SoC solution that sets a new standard in processing power for next-generation embedded designs. the Microchip ATmega32U4 8-bit AVR microcontroller, the same of Arduino\u00ae Leonardo. While the AMD Ryzen\u2122 Embedded V1000 processor can run all the Windows 10 and Linux 64-bit Distros you want to use as desktop PC, the Microchip ATmega32U4 allows easy access to a Arduino\u00ae Leonardo environment. The main AMD Ryzen\u2122 processor and the ATmega32u4 microcontroller are connected together through an internal USB serial connection, so it is exactly like you have an Arduino\u00ae Leonardo connected with a standard PC but all in small size form factor Single Board Computer. Download the User Manual to have more complete explanation of the UDOO BOLT hardware and features. Here you can find the Get Started and Safety instruction Manual for a quick installation. If you find any problem in the proper working of UDOO BOLT you can check the Troubleshooting page. Heads up! In order to prevent damages to your board, remember to: CE and FCC certifications retained using only the UDOO BOLT qualified Power Supply. When not using UDOO BOLT qualified Power Supply, use 19VDC (min 60W power) PSUs certified for your country (make sure that the power cable is less than 3 mt. long). CE and FCC certifications retained with the board inside the UDOO BOLT metal case. When not available, we suggest using a case with the same attributes as the UDOO BOLT metal Case. This product should be operated in a well-ventilated environment and, if used inside a case, the case should not be covered. This product should be elevated on a stable, flat, electrically non-conductive surface whilst in operation, and clear from any object that can induce a short-circuit. Do not expose it to water, moisture or heat from any source; UDOO BOLT is designed for reliable operation at normal ambient room temperatures. Avoid handling the warm and moving parts (like the fan) and generally the printed circuit board while it is powered. Only handle by the edges to minimise the risk of electrostatic discharge damage. Take care whilst handling to avoid mechanical or electrical damage to the printed circuit board and connectors. Also use a grounded wrist strap or touch a safely grounded object before you handle components. Never provide more than 5V in input to the GPIOs of the Arduino Leonardo-compatible(Atmel\u00ae ATmega32U4), and never provide more than 3.3V in input to the GPIOs of the Embedded Controller. Do not use a NON-standard USB 3.0 peripheral. If you use a non-standard USB 3.0 peripheral with an external power plug, this could send back the power source to the UDOO BOLT board with the risk of damage. The most important safety rule of all: Always Be Careful! (ABC) Lineup UDOO BOLT retail line up consists of two models.

The baud rate goes from 50 to 3000000. The UARTs are directly propagated to the OS as Legacy UART so you can already interact with they. UARTs on Linux On Linux the UARTs are seen as standard tty devices. The addresses are set by default to 0x3f8 and 0x2f8. You should find the UARTs available on the devices \/dev\/ttyS0 and \/dev\/ttyS1 on Ubuntu with a baudrate of 115200. The device name assigned by the Linux Distro you are using can change, you can check the name assigned running the command: dmesg | grep tty UARTs on Windows 10 On Windows the UARTs are seen as standard COM devices. The addresses are set by default to 0x3f8 and 0x2f8. You should find the UARTs available on the devices COM1 and COM2 on Windows 10. I2C 1 and I2C 2 The I2C (Inter-IC) bus is a bi-directional, two-wire serial bus that provides a communication link between integrated circuits (ICs). Phillips introduced the I2C bus 20 years ago for mass-produced items such as televisions, VCRs, and audio equipment. Today, I2C is the de-facto solution for embedded applications. The I2C 1 is available at Pins 8, 10. The I2C 2 is available at Pins 7, 9.

You can use the I2C exposed by the EC using the EAPI libraries in your software. SPI The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial communication interface specification used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. The SPI may be accurately described as a synchronous serial interface, but it is different from the Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) protocol, which is also a four-wire synchronous serial communication protocol. The SPI is available at Pins 1, 2, 3, 4. Pin Function EC PAD 1 SPI_MISO SPI0_MISO 2 SPI_CS# SPI0_CS# 3 SPI_MOSI SPI0_MOSI 4 SPI_CLK SPI0_CLK You can use the SPI exposed by the EC using the EAPI libraries in your software. Fan Controller You can control an external Fan using the Fan Controller Pins. The Fan controller is available at Pins 11, 12. Pin Function EC PAD 11 FANOUT0 PWM0 12 FANTACH0 FAN_TACH0 The Fan Out is used as a PWM output to control the Fan Speed. The Fan Tachometer is used as in Input to capture the Fan Speed. Remember you also need to provide the Voltage and Ground Pins to the external Fan. These two signals (out and tachometer) are only 3.3V digital pins exposed by the controller and therefore do not deliver power. To drive a 3-pin fan you need a power circuit that gives the right voltage to the fan. For example, this is the circuit used to drive the 5V fan installed above the heatsink: You can control these Fan Pins using the EAPI libraries in your software. Wake Pins The Wake pin can be used as an interrupt, the signal is caught by the EC and propagated to wake up the main AMD Ryzen\u2122 processor from S3\/S4\/S5 status (Suspend\/Hibernate\/Power Off). The Wake is available at Pin 6. Pin Function EC PAD 6 WAKE# GPIO025 The wake signal is activated by a logical state change on the Pin (e.g. active low from 3.3V to GND).

Famous Linux distributions Here you can find an unordered list of 10 of the most popular Linux distributions: Ubuntu: is probably the most well-known Linux distribution. Ubuntu is based on Debian, but it has its own software repositories. Much of the software in these repositories is synced from Debian\u2019s repositories. Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo is the latest Ubuntu released version. Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver is the latest Long Term Support version with a support end of life on April 2023. In the V-Series V1000 Drivers &amp; Support | AMD page you can find AMD stable drivers to support Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS. Linux Mint is a Linux distribution built on top of Ubuntu. It uses Ubuntu\u2019s software repositories, so the same packages are available on both. Originally, Mint was an alternative distribution loved mainly because it included media codecs and proprietary software that Ubuntu didn\u2019t include by default. Debian is an operating system composed only of free, open-source software. The Debian project has been operating since 1993 \u2014 over 20 years ago! This widely respected project is still releasing new versions of Debian, but it\u2019s known for moving much more slowly than distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint. This can make it more stable and conservative, which is ideal for some systems. Arch Linux is more old school than many of the other Linux distributions here. It\u2019s designed to be flexible, lightweight, minimal, and to \u201cKeep it Simple.\u201d Keeping it simple doesn\u2019t mean Arch provides tons of graphical utilities and automatic configuration scripts to help you set up your system. Instead, it means Arch dispenses with that stuff and gets out of your way. Fedora is a project with a strong focus on free software \u2014 you won\u2019t find an easy way to install proprietary graphics drivers here, although third-party repositories are available. Fedora is bleeding edge and contains the latest versions of software. CentOS \/ Red Hat Enterprise Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a commercial Linux distribution intended for servers and workstations. It\u2019s based on the open-source Fedora project, but is designed to be a stable platform with long-term support. CentOS and Red Hat recently announced they\u2019re collaborating, so CentOS is now part of Red Hat itself. openSUSE \/ SUSE Linux Enterprise openSUSE is a community-created Linux distribution sponsored by Novell. Novell purchased SuSE Linux in 2003, and they still create an enterprise Linux project known as SUSE Linux Enterprise. Where Red Hat has the Fedora project that feeds into Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Novell has the openSUSE project that feeds into SUSE Linux Enterprise. Mageia and Mandriva Mageia is a fork of Mandriva Linux created in 2011. Mandriva \u2014 known as Mandrake before that \u2014 was once one of the great user-friendly Linux distributions. Slackware Linux is another institution. Founded in 1993, Slackware is the oldest Linux distribution that\u2019s still maintained and putting out new releases today. Puppy Linux is another fairly well-known Linux distribution. Previous versions have been built on Ubuntu, but the latest is built on Slackware. Puppy is designed to be a small, lightweight operating system that can run well on very old computers. Others useful distributions: LibreELEC \u2013 Just enough OS for KODI Kodi is a free and open-source media player software application developed by the XBMC Foundation. LibreELEC (short for Libre Embedded Linux Entertainment Center) is a distro based on Kodi, is a non-profit fork of OpenELEC as an open source just enough OS (JeOS) Linux software appliance distro for Kodi.

Newer versions of Ubuntu than 18.04 are not affected by this issue so you don't need to use this procedure. There is a known issue with amdgpu driver which comes with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (and maybe others Linux distros). During and after OS installation it is possible that you may receive a UI after login or you may not. You can find all the references about this issue in the amdgpu Documentation (amdgpu_UserGuide) in the driver packages downloadable from the AMD official website. Check the Linux Drivers section to download the latest driver package. If you experience this problem during the installation of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (or in a different Linux distro) follow the instructions below or install a newer version of Ubuntu or the optimized version of Ubuntu 19.04 we've published in the start page of the Linux section To workaround this issue you need to start the installation by adding nomodeset parameter to grub. Adding nomodeset doesn\u2019t load amdgpu driver which comes with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and you will get the UI after login. Procedure to add nomodeset to grub: Stop the installation to the grub menu. Press e to edit the menu entry you choose (e.g Install Ubuntu) and it will lead to edit the boot parameters. Find the line which ends with quiet splash and add nomodeset in front of it. So it becomes nomodeset quiet splash. Whatever is there in front of it leave it as it is just add nomodeset in front of quiet splash. Press Ctrl+X or F10 to boot with this new parameter. You can check this post or this other post to see an image that will let better understand where to put the nomodeset parameter. Editing the grub like this is just a temporary fix, you probably will need to repeat the procedure after the installation to boot the system. After you've installed Ubuntu 18.04 LTS you can install the AMD drivers following the Linux Drivers section, to have a proper working system. If you don't need the AMD drivers you can set the fix the nomodeset boot option permanently so that you don't have to go through this manual procedure again following the instructions in this post. eMMC Usage and Installation Info! The Linux Kernel mainline with version &gt;=5.2.5 includes support for the AMD eMMC driver for Ryzen v1000 embedded series processors. Some Linux distributions with a kernel version &gt;=5.2.5 such as ArchLinux or Manjaro have already been released and support correctly the UDOO BOLT eMMC. Unfortunately, the AMD eMMC driver for the Ryzen v1000 embedded series processors was not included in the mainline Linux Kernel before version 5.2.5, so it will not be possible to install a standard Linux distribution on the eMMC with an older kernel than that version(&lt; 5.2.5) onboard the UDOO BOLT eMMC without some tweaks. To install a Linux distro with a kernel older than 5.2.5 on the eMMC, a kernel patch released by AMD is needed. The package released by AMD is going to guide you through a creation of a Ubuntu 18.04.1 installation image .iso file with the Linux Kernel 4.15.18 patched to support the AMD eMMC driver, you can download the patch here: emmc_v1000_patch.zip SHA1SUM: 6FB569D462701E16F70405BC107CE0F91C87F26C emmc_v1000_patch.zip We recompiled the AMD kernel source contained in the GPU driver package by adding the patch for eMMC support and you can download them here: udoo_bolt_linux-4.19.8_amd64_amdgpu_emmc.tar.gz SHA1SUM: bd546f5497069ce35af5c18112ebd0f314fa6115 udoo_bolt_linux-4.19.8_amd64_amdgpu_emmc.tar.gz Extract the package and install the custom kernel using the command dpkg -i with the three .deb files in the package.","tags":"","url":"Operating_Systems\/Linux\/Known_issues.html"},{"title":"Drivers","text":"AMD Vega graphics card used by the UDOO BOLT is fully supported in Linux. In this page you can find anything you need to know regarding the Linux Drivers. AMDGPU and AMDGPU-Pro AMDGPU is AMD's fully open source unified graphics Linux driver included in the mainline Linux Kernel for Vega GPUs and Raven Ridge APUs. AMDGPU-PRO is the closed source component that operates on top of the open source AMDGPU for alternative 3D application. from the Gentoo Linux docs we report an exhaustive explanation of the situations in which it is convenient to use one or other version of the driver: Users whose main use for their graphics card is gaming and other general home-use graphical hardware acceleration should use the open source AMDGPU drivers, since the performance of the open source drivers can be as much 100% more compared to AMDGPU-Pro. However, the PRO driver provides a few features that Mesa still lacks, namely OpenGL compatibility profiles, OpenCL 2.0, and a fully conformant Vulkan implementation. Also, most of the games for which Mesa outperforms the closed-source driver run in Wine, rather than natively. Thus, the closed-source driver is mostly useful to users who want to play games (such as Civilization V) or use applications (such as UCSF Chimera) that rely on compatibility profiles, or want to run anything that uses Vulkan with advanced shaders, or want to fully exploit OpenCL. Info For most of the users so the amdgpu open source drivers are enough and work well for all the test we made. AMDGPU If you want to use the amdgpu open source drivers, all you have to do is install a Linux distribution.

USB Devices The USB serial device where you can find the Arduino Leonardo-compatible (ATmega32U4) embedded may vary in accordance with the number of USB devices connected to the board. Usually, you should find the Arduino Leonardo-compatible in the COM3 in Windows 10 and \/dev\/ttyACM0 in Unix\/Linux OS. Linux Installation There are known issues with the Arduino\u00ae IDE on Linux that can lead to malfunctions and difficulties in uploading sketches. These known issues have been solved by Arduino (from version 1.8.6 of the IDE) with a script to launch immediately after installing the IDE on the system. We suggest so to use the scripts contained in the Arduino package to install the software and fix these issues. After downloading the package from the official website, and extracting it, you should then run the following commands in a terminal to install the Arduino IDE on your Linux system: sudo .\/install.sh .\/arduino-linux-setup.sh $USER Known issues Heads up! The arduino-linux-setup.sh above will solve the issues of user permissions and sketch upload described below. If you are working with an old version of the IDE where this script is not present you can try to copy it from a new version or manually fix the issues as described below. User permissions Some Linux distributions need to be configured to gain upload permissions to the user to the Arduino tty port. If you find some complications in uploading the Arduino sketch(firmware) through the Arduino IDE, try to add your Linux user to the dialout group with this command: sudo usermod -a -G tty &lt;yourUserName&gt; sudo usermod -a -G dialout &lt;yourUserName&gt; where &lt;yourUserName&gt; is your Linux user name. You will need to log out and log in again for this change to take effect. Sketch upload ModemManager conflict If you have issues when trying to upload a sketch on the Arduino Leonardo-compatible ATmega32U4 of UDOO BOLT you probably have a conflict with the program ModemManager (installed by default on many Linux distros like Ubuntu). Modem Manager tries to open any serial port (ttyACM0 of the Arduino Leonardo included) checking if it's a modem and this usually creates conflicts with the upload mechanism. If you have installed ModemManager on your Linux you can try to disable or uninstall it (https:\/\/askubuntu.com\/questions\/216114\/how-can-i-remove-modem-manager-from-boot) Since you probably don't have a modem on your UDOO BOLT you can safely uninstall the package to solve the issue or disable it running the commands: sudo systemctl stop ModemManager.service sudo systemctl disable ModemManager.service After this procedure, you should be able to proceed normally and upload the sketch to your board or use the Serial Monitor. The solution of this issue was found in this thread of the Arduino Forum. How to restore the correct uploading state of sketches If you have not taken into account the possible conflict between ModemManager and sketch upload and you have not followed the instructions listed above, it may happen that the Arduino microcontroller is set in a state where the operating system does not see the serial port. This no longer allows you to load the sketch also using a different operating system. To exit from this state you can try to perform the procedure indicated by the Arduino Leonardo page. Pressing the Arduino physical reset button with the right timing it is possible to load a sketch when the serial port of the bootloader is exposed and restore the correct functioning of the ATmega32U4 microcontroller of Arduino Leonardo. Summarising, you need to hit the Arduino IDE Upload button and press the Arduino physical reset button with the right timing immediately after you see the message &quot;Uploading...&quot; appear in the software's status bar. Enable the verbose option of the Arduino IDE upload process can be very useful to understand when to correctly press the reset button . To do so, go to the menu File -&gt; Preference and check the upload option box in the &quot;Show verbose output during&quot; section. The correct time to press the reset button is when starts to appear PORT {} \/ {} =&gt; {} in the log. The IDE will see that port appear and perform the upload using it. Heads up! This won't work if something interferes with the board's USB communication so please, be sure to have resolved such issues as the conflict with ModemManager above.","tags":"","url":"Arduino_Leonardo_compatible(ATmega32U4)\/Getting_Started_with_Arduino_Leonardo.html"},{"title":"Pinout","text":"The embedded Arduino Leonardo-compatible input\/output (I\/O) pins operates at 5V, with a maximum 40 mA DC current per pin.

For an explanation of PWM, refer to the following Arduino tutorial The pins 3 (interrupt 0), 2 (interrupt 1), 0 (interrupt 2), 1 (interrupt 3) and 7 (interrupt 4) can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. See the attachInterrupt() function for details. Grove connectors The UDOO BOLT features 3 Grove connectors to use Sensors and actuators from the Grove System by Seeed. The 3 Grove connectors are directly connected to the same pins of the external pinout. Grove Connector Conn.

Some wireless or mechanical keyboards that doesn't respect the standard USB HID protocol could doesn't work in the UEFI BIOS Firmware menu. Regarding the wireless keyboards we tested these that are proper working also in the UEFI BIOS menu: Logitech k400r, Logitech k400 plus, Microsoft All-in-One Media Keyboard. Please do NOT \"play\" with the BIOS-UEFI Firmware menu choices if you don't know what you are doing. For example, if you disable USB ports or Video Outputs you will not be able to interact with the BIOS-UEFI Firmware again to revert this condition. If you stumbling upon this case take a look at the Restore Factory configuration section below. Heads up! Since some resolutions or monitors are not managed well by the firmware, if you get a black screen when you try to enter in one of the UEFI Firmware Setup Utility Menu options, try using another Display with a 1920x1080 resolution (HDMI or DisplayPort) or a different cable.

UDOO BOLT Hardware and UEFI BIOS User Manual For a complete explanation of the System Configuration Utility menu items you can download the exhaustive UDOO BOLT Hardware and UEFI BIOS User Manual Restore Factory configuration In some cases, a wrong configuration of BIOS parameters could lead the module in an unusable state (i.e. no video output, all USB HID devices disabled). For these cases, on the module it has been placed a 3-way switch which can be used to restore the BIOS to factory default configuration. To do so, it is necessary to place the contact of the switch in 1-2 position, then turn on the module, wait until the board resets itself then turn off the module. The contact MUST be now placed back to 2-3 position. During normal use, the contact MUST be always placed in 2-3 position. You can restore the optimized factory default settings also from within the BIOS\/UEFI pressing the F3 key. Heads up! Updating the BIOS\/UEFI to a newer version will also restore the new factory default configuration.","tags":"","url":"BIOS_UEFI_and_Tools\/BIOS_UEFI_Firmware.html"},{"title":"BIOS-UEFI Update","text":"At the following link you can find the latest BIOS\/UEFI Firmware and the BIOS\/UEFI Update Utility to quickly and easily update the UDOO BOLT with the new BIOS\/UEFI Firmware version.

The fan that cools the Ryzen\u2122 processor of the UDOO BOLT is a 5V powered fan with PWM signal speed management and is managed entirely by the board's Embedded Controller. The full management of the fan settings described below is possible starting from BIOS\/UEFI Firmware version 1.07. Heads up! Please, always keep updated the BIOS\/UEFI Firmware of your UDOO BOLT to have the latest features and bugfix available. BIOS\/UEFI Fan Settings Here a detailed description of the fan settings and its default values. Advanced --&gt; Embedded Controller --&gt; Internal Fan settings Enhanced 3 wire RPM measurement &lt;Disabled&gt; Automatic Temperature FAN Control &lt;Enabled&gt; AC0 Temperature (C) &lt;85&gt; AC1 Temperature (C) &lt;70&gt; Temperature Hysteresis 5 FAN Duty Cycle (%) Above AC1 35 Speed change duration 0 Enhanced 3 wire RPM measurement refers to an algorithm necessary for the consistent reading of the current fan speed to respond to the tachometer signal. This data is made available by EAPI libraries. The algorithm set the speed fan to 100% for 100 milliseconds every 3 seconds. This is the standard way for the 3 wires fan to have a consistent reading of the speed. By default it is disabled because it can create a perceptible non-linear motion sound effect on some fans or some assembly situations. AC0 Temperature indicates the temperature above which the fan start turns on at full 100% rotation speed. AC1 Temperature indicates the temperature above which the fan start turns on at the % rotation speed indicated by the FAN Duty Cycle (%) Above AC1 value. Temperature Hysteresis This value is added to AC0 and AC1 when temperature is growing and subtracted when it is lowering to avoid oscillation. FAN Duty Cycle (%) Above AC1 is the percentage speed at which the fan turns when the processor's temperature is in the range between AC1 and AC0. Speed change duration indicates the time with which the speed changes linearly from one speed value to another (it is a ramp in practice, if set to 0 the fan will start directly at the right speed, if other values are set the fan will start more slowly and arrive at the selected speed more gradually). Info Preset values above are designed for a normal desktop working environment. These settings help minimize fan noise while keeping the system properly cooled in a normal working environment. The default settings may be modified in future BIOS revisions as UDOO continues to fine-tune them to get the best trade-off between cooling and fan acoustics. You may need to change the fan settings if your usage model includes any of the following: Heavy image\/video processing or analysis. Gaming, Stress testing or Benchmarking. Sustained processor usage of 75% or higher, for a long period. If you are in one of these usage scenarios, we suggest raising the value of FAN Duty Cycle % Above AC1 and lowering the AC1 Temperature and AC0 Temperature to maintain a lower processor operating temperature and be sure to always use maximum performance. if the fan is changed to one that does not handle PWM rotation speed, it is important for proper fan operation to set the values for FAN Duty Cycle % Above AC1 to 100 and Speed change duration to 0. If you are one of the Kickstarter users and you see a Green Dot \ud83d\udfe2 on one side of the fan, your fan is not handling the PWM speed correctly, so please set the FAN Duty Cycle % Above AC1 to 100 and Speed change duration to 0. If you still have a problem with this fan after applying these settings, please open a ticket in the customer care support center.","tags":"","url":"BIOS_UEFI_and_Tools\/Fan_Settings.html"},{"title":"Troubleshooting","text":"If you find any problem in the proper working of UDOO BOLT, please consult this section. My UDOO BOLT doesn't boot or restart itself continuously If your UDOO BOLT does NOT boot or restarts all the time, please check the following points: When the power jack is inserted the board does not start automatically. The power status LED is yellow\/amber\/orange and the board is in the power off state. To turn on UDOO BOLT you have to press the small power button on the front of the board. The status LED turns green when the board is powered on. Check the power button position in the Hardware Reference - Overview page. Check the power source you are applying to UDOO BOLT. Please, follow the Power Sources page or consult the User Manual to learn more about the power supply needed by the board for normal operation. Check that the restore factory configuration switch is in the right position for normal operation, otherwise the board will restart continuously. You can find info about that switch in the BIOS-UEFI Firmware page or consulting the User Manual. Try detaching all peripherals connected to UDOO BOLT except RAM and video cable. You should be able to see the UDOO LOGO and the first page of the BIOS. If you are using 2 RAM modules, try using only one RAM module at a time in the socket closest to the heatsink. If the card does not boot with either RAM modules, try using one RAM module at a time in the other socket, the one farthest from the heatsink. This is useful to rule out a problem with one of the RAM modules or one of the RAM sockets. I see an orange LED (D13) blinking The D13 orange LED you see is the standard Arduino LED 13. The Arduino\u00ae microcontroller (ATmega32U4) onboardM comes with an Arduino sketch (firmware) preinstalled that just blink the LED every 1 second. This is the standard Arduino first example and it is used in the board testing phase to check if the microcontroller side and communication works properly. The Fan on top of the heatsink has a strange behaviour If you are one of the Kickstarter users and you see a Green Dot \ud83d\udfe2 on one side of the fan, please check the warnings in Fan Settings page to know how to configure the BIOS settings for your fan. An incorrect configuration can also cause the UDOO BOLT to shut down because it cannot dissipate heat properly. Blue Screen stop errors occur on my Windows installation. If you have installed Windows on an external drive (M.2 or SATA) and occasionally there are Blue Screen stop error events (commonly called BSOD) the problem may be related to a strange behavior of the Windows eMMC driver that throws sporadic errors in memory access. This behavior is more frequent when the UDOO BOLT is in idle state. We suggest not using eMMC memory and disable it from the Device Manager. To do so: right click on Start -&gt; Device Manager -&gt; Expand the section &quot;Disk drives&quot; -&gt; right click on SanDisk DF4032 -&gt; click on &quot;Disable&quot;. I can't install Linux distros on eMMC If you are trying to install a Linux distribution on the UDOO BOLT eMMC but it is not seen by the installer wizard, please follow the eMMC Usage and Installations section in the Linux - Known issues page. Probably the Linux distro you are trying to install use a Linux Kernel older than the 5.2.5 version. A Ubuntu 19.04 optimized version for UDOO BOLT that solves this issue is downloadable from the Linux section. However, newer Ubuntu version like the 19.10 or 20.04 allow the installation on the eMMC because already integrates a version of the Linux Kernel later than 5.2.5. I can't upload sketches to Arduino Leonardo onboard If you have any trouble uploading Arduino sketches running Linux, check the Linux - known issues section in the Getting Started with Arduino Leonardo page. Here you can find a procedure for trying to restore the correct uploading state of sketches.","tags":"","url":"Troubleshooting\/index.html"}]}
